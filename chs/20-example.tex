\chapter{An example thesis design} \label{chap:thesis}

    Many universities in the United States have strict regulations about 
the typography of theses.
The title and administrative pages are inherently specific to a particular 
university, but often the design for the body of the thesis clashes 
with normally accepted typographic practice. This chapter presents 
fairly typical guidelines for some US universities and code intended 
to meet them. Let's call the university in question the 
\emph{Archibald Smythe University}, or ASU for short. 

    The requirements that are listed below are not from any single
university but I have, over the years, seen each one of them. In reality
there are likely to be many more nit-picking rules than I have shown.

    It amuses me that I have never seen a printed set of requirements that 
followed the rules laid down therein.

    Universities outside the US tend to be more relaxed with the result
that theses from these establishments are very often more attractive (certainly
less bulky) and more readable. The ASU requirements lead to an exceptionally
dull and unattractive appearance.

\section{Example US thesis typographic requirements}

\subsection{General}  

\begin{description}
\item[Paper size] The thesis shall be printed on 8.5 by 11 inch plain
white paper.

\item[Single-sided] The thesis shall be printed single-sided; that is,
one side of each sheet of paper will be blank.

\item[Margins] Every page of the document shall meet the requirements of
a 1.5~inch margin on the left and a 1~inch margin at the top, right, and 
bottom of the page. Nothing shall appear in any margin.

\item[Fonts] The thesis may be set in 10, 11 or 12pt 
Arial\index{Arial}, 
Century\index{Century}, 
Garamond\index{Garamond},
Lucida Bright\index{Lucida Bright} (10pt only), 
Tahoma\index{Tahoma}, 
Times\index{Times}, or 
Verdana\index{Verdana}. 
The same font and size shall be used throughout the thesis. 

    There shall be no bold type.

 Italic type (or underlining) is limited to the names of species, genera, 
book titles, musical compositions, or foreign words.

\item[Line Spacing] All text shall be double-spaced, except material in tables
and the optional biographical sketch (which must be single-spaced). You shall
single-space individual footnotes and endnotes with a double space between
each entry.
\end{description}

\subsection{Preliminary matter}

The preliminary matter consists of the following pages in this
order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Title page
\item Approval page
\item Abstract
\item Dedication (optional)
\item Acknowledgements (optional)
\item Table of contents
\item List of tables (if there are any tables)
\item List of figures (if there are any figures)
\item Other lists (e.g., nomenclature, definitions, glossary of terms, etc.)
\item Preface (optional but must be less than ten pages)
\item Under special circumstances further sections may be allowed
\end{enumerate}

    The heading for each preliminary page (except the Dedication which shall
not have a heading) is centered between the margins, in all capital letters,
double-spaced and begin on the first line below the top margin.

    The title and approval page are counted as pages one and two, but
no page numbers shall appear on them. All subsequent preliminary pages are 
paginated with lowercase Roman numerals. Starting with `iii' on the abstract
page, place all page numbers at the bottom of the page, centered between
the left and right margins and upon the 1~inch bottom margin. Continue
numbering consecutively on the subsequent pages up to the first page
of the main text. 

\subsubsection{Title page}

\begin{enumerate}
\item All text shall be centered between the side margins.

\item Set the title in all capital letters, double-spaced, 
starting at the top of the page (but below the top margin).
\item On a new line (double-spaced) type `by' in lowercase letters.
\item On a new line (double-spaced) type your full legal name.
\item At the center of the page type the appropriate description for
your degree with the exact wording and line breaks as shown, and single-spaced:
\begin{quote} \centering
A \rule{1in}{0.4pt} Presented in Partial Fulfillment \\
of the Requirements for the Degree \\
\rule{2in}{0.4pt}
\end{quote}
    Replace the blanks with the appropriate wording: Thesis and Master
of Arts or Dissertation and Doctor of Philosophy.
\item At the bottom of the page type `ARCHIBALD SMYTHE UNIVERSITY' in all 
     capitals.
\item Type the month and year of the date you will graduate, with the
month in title case and no comma between the month and year.
\item The space between your name and the degree description should equal
the space between the degree description and the name of the University.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Approval page}

\begin{enumerate}
\item All text shall be centered between the side margins.

\item Set the title in all capital letters, double-spaced, 
starting at the top of the page (but below the top margin).
\item On a new line (double-spaced) type `by' in lowercase letters.
\item On a new line (double-spaced) type your full legal name in
title-cased letters.
\item Add two double-spaced lines (four single-spaced lines) and type
`has been aproved' in lowercase
\item Add a double-space.
\item Type the month and year of your oral defense, with the
month in title case and no comma between the month and year.

\item At about the center of the page type `Graduate Supervisory Committee:'
\item A blank (double-spaced) line
\item Type the members' names, without titles, one per line, 
      single-spaced, as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If you have one chair, type: the chair's name, comma, space `Chair'
  \item If two chairs, type: comma, space, `Co-Chair' after the first two names
  \item Follow with the other members' names.
  \end{enumerate}
\item At the bottom of the page, type `ACCEPTED BY THE GRADUATE COLLEGE'
\item The space between the date and `Graduate Supervisory Committe' lines
should equal the space between the last member's name and the `ACCEPTED\ldots'
line.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Abstract page}

    Center the title `ABSTRACT' at the top of the page. Number the page
at the bottom, centered with the Roman numeral `iii'. If there is a second 
page, number it similarly with `iv'.

\subsubsection{Dedication and Acknowledgements (optional)}

\begin{itemize}
\item  The dedication and acknowledgements together must not exceed three 
pages.
\item The dedication page is not titled and the text should be centered both
vertically and horizontally.
\item The heading for the acknowledgements page is `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS', centered
and at the top of the page.
\item Continue the page numbering in lowercase Roman, at the bottom and 
centered.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Table of contents}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Type `TABLE OF CONTENTS' centered at the top of the page.
\item On the next line type the word `Page' right justified
\item Begin listing any preliminary pages that follow the table of contents
(e.g., lists) in ALL CAPS. The title is left justified, the page number is
right justified and a dotted line fills the gap between.
\item Double space between entries.
\item Chapter headings and subheadings to three levels shall be listed, 
with a lower level being indented with respect to a higher level. 
\item The wording of headings shall correspond exactly to those in
the main body.
\item The page number is centered at the bottom of the page.
\item If the listing continues for more than one page, subsequent pages
shall be headed with one line consisting of `Chapter' left justified 
and `Page' right justified.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Lists}

    For a given kind of list (often figures or tables) called, say, `things':
\begin{enumerate}
\item Type `LIST OF THINGS' centered at the top of the page.
\item On the next line type `Thing' left justified and `Page' right justified.
\item List, double-spaced, the caption or title of the thing left justified
and the page number right justified, with a dotted line between them.
\item Use Roman lowercase to number the page(s) at the bottom, centered.
\item If the listing continues for more than one page, subsequent pages
shall be headed with one line consisting of `Thing' left justified 
and `Page' right justified.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Main text}

    Nothing shall appear in the margins.

    The top line on a page is the line immediately below the top margin.
The top text line is the one following that (i.e. the second line below
the margin).

\subsubsection{Page numbering}

    All pages are counted, but the first page of each chapter is not 
numbered (paginated); other pages are paginated. The first page of the 
main text is counted as number 1. Numbered pages have the number right 
justified on the top line.

\subsubsection{Headings}

   Chapter headings shall be centered. On the top line type `Chapter' followed
by the number. On the top text line type the heading in all uppercase. 
Type the text on the subsequent lines.

   Subheadings, consisting of the number and title (not in all caps), 
shall be centered, with one blank line before and after.

\subsubsection{Captions}

Table captions, which are left justified, shall be put before the table 
itself. The first line consists of `Table' followed by the number; the caption
wording commences on the next line.

Captions for figures are similar, except that they shall be put below the 
figure and `Table' replaced by `Figure'.

Tables and figures shall be single-spaced.

\subsubsection{Notes}

    Notes may be placed at the bottom of the page (i.e., footnotes), or
grouped in the backmatter (i.e., endnotes) before the reference list.

    All notes shall be introduced by a superior number in the text, with
the same number used for the text of the note. Notes should be single spaced,
with double spacing between them.

\subsection{Backmatter}

    The backmatter consists of the following pages, in order (all of which
are optional).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Notes (if you are using endnotes and grouping them at the end)
\item References (AKA `Bibliography' or `Works Cited')
\item Appendices
\item Biographical sketch (optional)
\end{enumerate}

    Pagination continues from the main text; but as with chapters, the first
pages of any notes, references, or appendices are not numbered. A biographical
sketch, if it is included, is the last page and is neither counted
nor paginated.

    Headings for the backmatter sections shall be in uppercase, centered, and
on the top line.

\subsubsection{Notes}

    The section for endnotes should begin on a new, unnumbered page. Subsequent
pages should be numbered.

    Use `NOTES', centered and at the top, as the heading for the notes section.

\subsubsection{References}

    Use the reference heading appropriate for your discipline, in uppercase,
centered and at the top of the page. Individual refences 
should be single-spaced with the second and later lines of a multiline
reference indented with respect to the first line. 
There should be double-spacing between references.

\subsubsection{Appendices}

    The heading for an appendix consists of the word `APPENDIX' followed by 
the uppercase letter signifying its position in the sequence of appendices
(e.g., A or B or C or \ldots).
This shall be centered on the top line. The title of the appendix, in 
uppercase, is centered on the following line. This page is not numbered.
Subsequent pages are numbered and the text commences on the top text line
of the following page.

\subsubsection{Biography}

    The title for the optional biographical page is `BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH', 
in the usual position. The text shall not exceed the one page.

\section{Code}

Given the above set of requirements we can produce code that,
hopefully, will generate documents that will not fall foul of the
inspectorate.  For simplicity I'll do the code in the form of a
package called \verb?pwasu.sty?.  I will be using some \ltx\ kernel
commands that you won't normally come across. Some of the macros
include \idxatincode\texttt{@} as part of their name but this is safe
as they are in a package, otherwise they would have to be within a
\cmd{\makeatletter} \ldots \cmd{\makeatother} grouping (\seeatincode).

\subsection{Initialisation}

    First, identify the package and its basic requirements.
\begin{lcode}
%%%% file pwasu.sty
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{pwasu}[2009/04/18 v0.3 ASU thesis]
\end{lcode}
This is only going to work with memoir, so check if the class is being
used, and if not then give an error message and stop reading the package code.
\begin{lcode}
%% Only works with the memoir class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
\@ifclassloaded{memoir}{\let\endpwasu\relax}{\let\endpwasu\endinput
  \PackageError{pwasu}{The pwasu package only works with the memoir class}%
               {\@ehd}}
\endpwasu

\end{lcode}

    ASU is very strict about only using a single font in a single size. 
It is probable that
at least one reference will be made to a location on the web. With \ltx\
such references are set using the \Lpack{url} package, which defaults
to using a monospaced font for urls. For ASU we have to make sure that
they will be made using the body font (and the same applies to any verbatim
text, such as computer code listings, for which we can use the 
\cmd{\setverbatimfont} command).
\begin{lcode}
\usepackage{url}
\urlstyle{same}
\setverbatimfont{\normalfont\rmfamily}% make verbatims use the body font
\end{lcode}
Ensuring that footnotes use the body font is a simple matter of redefining
\cmd{\foottextfont}.
\begin{lcode}
\renewcommand*{\foottextfont}{\normalfont\normalsize}

\end{lcode}


    Noticing that the requirements can involve switching between double
and single spacing, some of which will be done internally in the package,
give the user a chance to change the default double spacing. The argument
to \cs{setasuspacing} can be either \cmd{\OnehalfSpacing} or \cmd{\DoubleSpacing}.
 The result sets \cs{AsuSpacing} to be one of these commands.
\begin{lcode}
% To enable spacing to be changed if neccesary by the user
\newcommand*{\setasuspacing}[1]{%
  \let\AsuSpacing#1
  \AsuSpacing}
\setasuspacing{\DoubleSpacing}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{Page layout}

    As this is for an American University on letterpaper sized paper
we'll assume letterpaper stock, so
no cropping will be needed. Setting the side margins is easy:
\begin{lcode}
% left, right margins and textwidth
\setlrmarginsandblock{1.5in}{1in}{*}
\end{lcode}


Setting the top and bottom margins requires more thought. \ltx\ provides the 
header and footer areas for page numbers. However, the requirements state
that page numbers must be either on the top or bottom line (of the textblock)
with the text extending down to the bottom line or up to the top line (of
the textblock). I'll organise it according to the layout for the main body.
Here, the top of the header is 1 inch below the top of the paper and the
bottom of the text is 1 inch above the bottom of the paper (with the footer
below that).
\begin{lcode}
%% for main body, bottom of text at 1in, footer below
%% top of header at 1in, first text line double spaced 
%% below base of header
\newlength{\linespace}
\setlength{\linespace}{\baselineskip} % current equivalent of \onelineskip
\setlength{\headheight}{\onelineskip}
\setlength{\headsep}{\linespace}
\addtolength{\headsep}{-\topskip}
\setlength{\uppermargin}{1in}
\addtolength{\uppermargin}{\headheight}
\addtolength{\uppermargin}{\headsep}
\end{lcode}
And for the bottom margin:
\begin{lcode}
%% and for the bottom
\setlength{\lowermargin}{1in}
\setlength{\textheight}{\paperheight}
\addtolength{\textheight}{-\uppermargin}
\addtolength{\textheight}{-\lowermargin}
\end{lcode}
And finally for footnotes:
\begin{lcode}
%% footnote settings
\setlength{\footskip}{\onelineskip}
\setlength{\footnotesep}{\onelineskip}

\end{lcode}
The layout on the preliminary pages is different, so I'll need
some handy lengths in order to change the layout as appropriate.
The user can also make adjustments with these if necessary.
\begin{lcode}
%% the fiddle lengths (..ta.. for title/approval page, others for prelims)
\newlength{\toptafiddle} \setlength{\toptafiddle}{2\linespace}
\newlength{\bottafiddle} \setlength{\bottafiddle}{0pt}
\newlength{\topfiddle}   \setlength{\topfiddle}{\toptafiddle}
\newlength{\botfiddle}   \setlength{\botfiddle}{\onelineskip}
\end{lcode}
That's it for the general layout, except for increasing the paragraph 
indentation as the line spacing is larger than normal.
\begin{lcode}
\setlength{\parindent}{2em}
\checkandfixthelayout[nearest]

\end{lcode}

    As the layout is set up, the bottom of the text is one inch above the
bottom of the paper. This is fine for the main text and the Title and Approval
pages but the text height must be decreased, temporarily, for the other
pages in the prelims. Changes to the page layout\index{page layout!change} 
may be accomplished by
the following sneaky procedure.
First change from one- to two-column (or vice-versa), which starts a new 
page, make the changes, then change from two- to one-column (or vice-versa)
which starts the same new page again but with the layout changes implemented.
The following code implements this for the \cs{textheight} in a one
column document, which is what we are dealing with here.
\begin{lcode}
\newcommand*{\addtotextheight}[1]{%
  \twocolumn
  \addtolength{\textheight}{#1}%
  \onecolumn}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{Page styles}

    Next I'll tackle the page styles. The style for the main body is simple,
with the page number top right, and the \pstyle{empty} style is the one for 
chapter pages. The page number for the preliminary pages is centered
at the bottom, and the \pstyle{plain} page style provides that. For the main
text define the \pstyle{asu} page style.
\begin{lcode}
%%%% pagestyles
%% the main text
\makepagestyle{asu}
  \makeevenhead{asu}{\thepage}{}{}
  \makeoddhead{asu}{}{}{\thepage}
\end{lcode}

    Any `continuation' pages for the \toc, etc., have a header that consists 
of a name at the left and the word `Page' at the right. We need a header for
each kind of listing.
\begin{lcode}
%% for continuation pages of the ToC, LoF, LoT
\makepagestyle{toc}
  \makeevenfoot{toc}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeoddfoot{toc}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeevenhead{toc}{Chapter}{}{Page}
  \makeoddhead{toc}{Chapter}{}{Page}
\makepagestyle{lof}
  \makeevenfoot{lof}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeoddfoot{lof}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeevenhead{lof}{Figure}{}{Page}
  \makeoddhead{lof}{Figure}{}{Page}
\makepagestyle{lot}
  \makeevenfoot{lot}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeoddfoot{lot}{}{\thepage}{}
  \makeevenhead{lot}{Table}{}{Page}
  \makeoddhead{lot}{Table}{}{Page}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{The ToC and friends}

    While we're at it, do the code for the \lof\ and \lot, which is simpler
than that needed for the \toc. We have to specify our new pagestyles which
can be done by extending the \cs{listof...} macros. The \cmd{\addtodef}
macro makes this rather easy.
\begin{lcode}
%%%% The LoF
\renewcommand{\listfigurename}{LIST OF FIGURES}
\addtodef{\listoffigures}{\clearpage\pagestyle{lof}}{}
\end{lcode}
For the titles, these have to be moved up into the header area, so that
they come just below the top margin, and set the initial pagestyle as 
\pstyle{plain}. After the title we can insert the relevant column headers.
\begin{lcode}
\renewcommand*{\lofheadstart}{\vspace*{-\topfiddle}}
\renewcommand*{\afterloftitle}{\thispagestyle{plain}%
  \par\nobreak {\normalfont Figure \hfill Page}\par\nobreak}

\end{lcode}
And the same for the \lot.
\begin{lcode}
%%% The LoT
\renewcommand{\listtablename}{LIST OF TABLES}
\addtodef{\listoftables}{\clearpage\pagestyle{lot}}{}
\renewcommand*{\lotheadstart}{\vspace*{-\topfiddle}}
\renewcommand*{\afterlottitle}{\thispagestyle{plain}%
  \par\nobreak {\normalfont Table \hfill Page}\par\nobreak}

\end{lcode}

    The \toc\ is similar but we also have to deal with the entries themselves.
\begin{lcode}
%%%% Do the ToC
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{TABLE OF CONTENTS}
\addtodef{\tableofcontents}{\clearpage\pagestyle{toc}}{}
\renewcommand*{\tocheadstart}{\vspace*{-\topfiddle}}
\renewcommand*{\aftertoctitle}{\thispagestyle{plain}%
  \par\nobreak \mbox{}\hfill{\normalfont Page}\par\nobreak}
\end{lcode}
And the changes to the entries, all of which are set in the normal font
and with dotted leaders, with no extra space between any of the entries.
\begin{lcode}
\renewcommand*{\cftchapterfont}{\normalfont}
\renewcommand*{\cftchapterpagefont}{\normalfont}
\renewcommand*{\cftchapterleader}{%
  \cftchapterfont\cftdotfill{\cftchapterdotsep}}
\renewcommand*{\cftchapterdotsep}{\cftdotsep}
\end{lcode}
Unlike the typical \ltx\ \toc\ there must be no additional space before
chapter entries; also, there should be no additional space inserted by
the chapters in the \lof\ or \lot\ which just requires a simple redefinition
of \cmd{\insertchapterspace}..
\begin{lcode}
%%% no extra space before the entry, or in the LoF/LoT
\setlength{\cftbeforechapterskip}{0pt plus 0pt}
\renewcommand*{\insertchapterspace}{}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{Chapter styling}

    Moving on to styling the chapter titles, the first line must be moved up
into the header area, and other spacings set to give blank lines. The fonts
are just the regular body font. Call the chapterstyle \cstyle{asu} and make
sure that the \pstyle{empty} pagestyle is used for it.

\begin{lcode}
%% chapter style
\makechapterstyle{asu}{%
  \setlength{\beforechapskip}{-\topfiddle}
  \setlength{\midchapskip}{1.0\onelineskip}
  \setlength{\afterchapskip}{1.0\onelineskip}
  \renewcommand*{\chapnamefont}{\normalfont}
  \renewcommand*{\chapnumfont}{\chapnamefont}
  \renewcommand*{\printchapternum}{\centering\chapnumfont \thechapter}
  \renewcommand*{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\centering}
  \renewcommand*{\printchapternonum}{}}
\aliaspagestyle{chapter}{empty}

\end{lcode}

   The chapterstyle for any appendices is slightly different as the title,
all in uppercase, is
on one page by itself and the text starts on the following page. Call
this the \cstyle{asuappendix} chapterstyle.

\begin{lcode}
%% chapter style for appendices, text comes on following page
\makechapterstyle{asuappendix}{%
  \setlength{\beforechapskip}{-\topfiddle}
  \setlength{\midchapskip}{1.0\onelineskip}
  \setlength{\afterchapskip}{1.0\onelineskip}
  \renewcommand*{\chapnamefont}{\normalfont}
  \renewcommand*{\chapnumfont}{\chapnamefont}
  \renewcommand*{\printchaptername}{%
    \chapnamefont\MakeUppercase{\@chapapp}}
  \renewcommand*{\printchapternum}{\centering\chapnumfont \thechapter}
  \renewcommand*{\chaptitlefont}{\normalfont\centering}
  \renewcommand*{\printchapternonum}{}
  \renewcommand*{\afterchaptertitle}{\clearpage}}

\end{lcode}

   We have to extend the \cmd{\appendix} command to use the new chapter
style, and also to ensure that double spacing will be used (certain elements
that come before the appendices are single spaced).

\begin{lcode}
%%% different chapter style for appendices, (and double spaced)
\addtodef{\appendix}{}{\chapterstyle{asuappendix}\AsuSpacing}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{Section, etc., styling}

    Set up the section headings so that they are centered, use the normal
font, and have a blank line before and after.

\begin{lcode}
%%% (subsub)section styles
\setsecheadstyle{\centering\normalfont}
\setbeforesecskip{-1\onelineskip plus -1ex minus -.2ex}
\setaftersecskip{1\onelineskip plus .2ex}
\setsubsecheadstyle{\centering\normalfont}
\setbeforesubsecskip{-1\onelineskip plus -1ex minus -.2ex}
\setaftersubsecskip{1\onelineskip plus .2ex}
\end{lcode}


\subsection{Captions}

The captions are set flushleft and raggedright with the name and number
on one line and the title on the following line. Fortunately floats are 
automatically set single spaced, which is what the requirements specify.

\begin{lcode}
%% Captions
\captiontitlefont{\normalfont}% title font
\precaption{\raggedright}% for Caption N
\captiondelim{\newline}% newline
\captionstyle{\raggedright}% for title 
\setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{\onelineskip}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{The bibliography}

    The requirements imply that the title is likely to be `REFERENCES'. 
The bibliography is set single spaced but with a blank line between
the entries. 

\begin{lcode}
%% for REFERENCE section
\renewcommand*{\bibname}{REFERENCES}
\setlength{\bibitemsep}{\onelineskip}
\end{lcode}

    The second and later lines of any entry are to be indented. We use the
\cmd{\biblistextra} hook for setting this up.
\begin{lcode}
\renewcommand*{\biblistextra}{%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{\bibitemsep}
  \setlength{\labelwidth}{0pt}
  \setlength{\leftmargin}{3em}% hanging indent
  \setlength{\itemindent}{-\leftmargin}}
\end{lcode}

The title for the bibliography is set via the \cmd{\bibsection} macro.
The heading is unnumbered but is added to the \toc. To get the spacing
right the heading, set as a \cs{chapter*}, which must be called double spaced,
and then single spacing is called for after that.
\begin{lcode}
\renewcommand*{\bibsection}{%
  \AsuSpacing
  \chapter*{\bibname}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\bibname}
  \SingleSpacing}
\end{lcode}


\subsection{End notes}

    The heading for the Notes section is similar to the bibliography
heading.
\begin{lcode}
%% endnotes
\renewcommand*{\notesname}{NOTES}
\renewcommand*{\notedivision}{%
  \AsuSpacing
  \chapter*{\notesname}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\notesname}
  \SingleSpacing}
\end{lcode}

    The rest of the code for endnotes\index{endnotes} ensures that they are 
numbered
continuously throughout the text, the number is set as a superscript, that
there is a blank line between each entry, and that there are no subdivisions
within the listing.
\begin{lcode}
\continuousnotenums 
\renewcommand*{\notenuminnotes}[1]{\textsuperscript{#1}\space}
\renewcommand{\noteinnotes}[1]{#1\\}
\renewcommand*{\pagenotesubhead}[3]{}% no subheads
\end{lcode}

\subsection{Preliminary headings}

    There can be any number of sections in the prelims. The
titles for these are located in the \ltx\ header area. Here's a general 
macro for setting these.

\begin{lcode}
%%% general macro for Abstract, etc., headings
\newcommand*{\pretoctitle}[1]{{\clearpage\centering 
  \vspace*{-\topfiddle}#1\par}}
%%% Start the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\newcommand{\asuacknowledgements}{\pretoctitle{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}}

\end{lcode}

    The Abstract is the
first section after the title and approval pages. At this point we must reduce
the textheight in order to raise the footer area.
\begin{lcode}
%%% Start the ABSTRACT
\newcommand{\asuabstract}{%
  \addtotextheight{-\botfiddle}%
  \pretoctitle{ABSTRACT}}
\end{lcode}
    While we are at this, the textheight must be reset to its default value
just before the first chapter in the main matter. A simple addition to
\cmd{\mainmatter} handles this.
\begin{lcode}
\addtodef{\mainmatter}{\addtotextheight{\botfiddle}{}

\end{lcode}

    The dedication, if any, does not have a heading and the text is centered
horizontally and vertically. 
\begin{lcode}
%% make it easy to center any dedication
\newcommand{\asudedication}[1]{%
  {\clearpage\mbox{}\vfill\centering #1 \par\vfill\clearpage}}

\end{lcode}

    There may be sections in the prelims that come after the \toc, and
the titles of these are added to the \toc.
\begin{lcode}
%% for any headings after the tocloft and before the main body
\newcommand{\prelimtitle}[1]{%
  \pretoctitle{#1}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}}

\subsection{Components of the title and approval pages}

    There are several items that are set on the title and approval pages.
In order to separate the information from the particular layout, I've 
defined a macro for defining each item.
\begin{lcode}
%%%% for the title page and approval page. 
% your title
\newcommand{\settitle}[1]{\def\asutitle{#1}}
% you
\newcommand{\setauthor}[1]{\def\asuauthor{#1}}
% document type (e.g., thesis)
\newcommand{\setdoctype}[1]{\def\asudoctype{#1}}
% possible degree
\newcommand{\masters}{\def\asudegree{Master of Arts}}
\newcommand{\doctors}{\def\asudegree{Doctor of Philosophy}}
% defence date
\newcommand{\setdefdate}[1]{\def\asudefdate{#1}}
% graduation date
\newcommand{\setgraddate}[1]{\def\asugraddate{#1}}
% committe chair
\newcommand{\setchair}[1]{\def\asuchair{#1, Chair}}
% committe co-chairs
\newcommand{\setchairs}[2]{%
  \def\asuchair{#1, Co-chair \\ #2, Co-chair}}
% other members (separated by \\s)
\newcommand{\setmembers}[1]{\def\asumembers{#1\par}}

\end{lcode}

    Just for fun, create some default settings for these. The successful 
user will have changed them all!
\begin{lcode}
%% Use them like this, and if you don't change them you will
%% get unacceptable title and/or approval pages
\settitle{AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF WORK OVER WHICH I HAVE STRUGGLED
DAY AND NIGHT FOR FAR TOO LONG AND NOW IT IS OVER}
\setauthor{A. N. Author}
\setdoctype{Polemic}
\masters  % going for a Masters degree
%% \doctors % going for a PhD
\setdefdate{April 2018}
\setgraddate{May 2021}
% \setchair{A. Jones}           % this one
\setchairs{A. Jones}{B. Doe}  % or this one
\setmembers{C. Smith \\ D. Somebody \\ Some One Else \\ Yet Another}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{The title and approval pages}

\PWnote{2009/07/09}{Added 2 ASU figures}
An example of a title page is shown in \fref{fig:titleASUt} and 
an example of the corresponding approval page is in \fref{fig:titleASUa}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{showtitle}
  \titleASUt
\end{showtitle}
\caption{Example Archibald Smythe University title page}\label{fig:titleASUt}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{showtitle}
  \titleASUa
\end{showtitle}
\caption{Example Archibald Smythe University approval page}\label{fig:titleASUa}
\end{figure}

    Now we can set up the layouts for the title and approval pages. The
information typeset on these pages is obtained from the previous set of 
commands. Note that the last line on each of these pages has to be set
upon the bottom margin. The ASU inspectorate is likely to be very
keen on this, perhaps using a ruler to measure the actual distance from 
the bottom of the page to ensure that it is the magic 1~inch. I have
included an \cmd{\enlargethispage} by the amount \cs{bottafiddle} so the
user can make any fine adjustment that might be requested. Similarly, the
length \cs{toptafiddle} may be altered to fine tune the position of the
title. Hopefully, neither of these tweaks will be needed, but if so, then use
\cmd{\addtolength} instead of \cmd{\setlength} to make an adjustement.

\begin{lcode}
%%% typesets the TITLE page
\newcommand{\thetitlepage}{{%
  \clearpage
  \thispagestyle{empty}
  \centering
  \vspace*{-\toptafiddle}
  \asutitle \\ by \\ \asuauthor
  \vfill

  {\SingleSpace
  A \asudoctype\ Presented in Partial Fulfillment \\
  of the Requirements for the Degree \\
  \asudegree\par}

  \vfill
  ARCHIBALD SMYTHE UNIVERSITY \\
  \asugraddate 
  \par
  \enlargethispage{\bottafiddle}
  \clearpage}}

\end{lcode}

    And similary for the approval page.

\begin{lcode}
%%% typesets the APPROVAL page
\newcommand{\approvalpage}{{%
  \thispagestyle{empty}
  \centering
  \vspace*{-\toptafiddle}
  \asutitle \\ by \\ \asuauthor \\[3\onelineskip]
  has been approved \\
  \asudefdate

  \vfill

  Graduate Supervisory Committee: \\[-0.5\onelineskip]
  {\SingleSpacing
  \asuchair \\
  \asumembers}

  \vfill
  ACCEPTED BY THE GRADUATE COLLEGE 
  \par
  \enlargethispage{\bottafiddle}
  \clearpage}}
\end{lcode}

\subsection{The last bits}

    The biographical sketch has a title (which is not added to
the \toc), the text is single spaced and there is no page number. 
It is easiest to provide this as an environment.
\begin{lcode}
%%% put your biographical text in this environment
%% \begin{biosketch} I'm a person who has accomplished .... \end{biosketch}
\newenvironment{biosketch}{%
  \pretoctitle{BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH}\thispagestyle{empty}\SingleSpacing}%
  {}
\end{lcode}

    Make sure that the requisite initial page style and appropriate
chapter style is used.
\begin{lcode}
%% use the asu chapterstyle and plain pagestyle
\chapterstyle{asu}
\pagestyle{plain}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end of *.sty file
\endinput
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{lcode}

\section{Usage}

    This is a sketch of how an ASU thesis could be written. 

  With the wide textblock, 12pt is too small for reading ease, so best not
to use 11pt or 10pt.

    Times Roman\index{Times Roman} comes with \ltx, but you are 
effectively writing a book, 
not a newspaper column. If you have Garamond\index{Garamond} 
or Lucida Bright\index{Lucida Bright} then 
seriously consider using one or other of them.\footnote{Garamond is a 
commercial font and, for example, is available along with many other fonts 
from FontSite (\url{http://www.fontsite.com})
with \ltx\ support from \url{http://contrapunctus.net/fs500tex}.
Lucida Bright, another commercial font,
is available from TUG at \url{http://tug.org/store/lucida} and is supported
by several \ltx\ packages.} Lucida Bright is probably more appropriate if
your thesis includes mathematics while Garamond is perhaps more in keeping
if your thesis topic falls into the humanities area.
If the requirements did not limit your choices then there are other
fonts that might better express your work. In any case
I suggest that you do not use a sans font (e.g.,
Arial\index{Arial},
Tahoma\index{Tahoma} or
Verdana\index{Verdana} from the ASU list).

\begin{lcode}
\documentclass[oneside,12pt]{memoir}
\usepackage{mathptmx}  % Times New Roman
\usepackage{pwasu}     % the package

\end{lcode}

    The general sequence in your document, after you have set the data for
the TITLE and APPROVAL pages and any other specifics and packages in the 
preamble, is:
\begin{lcode}
%  if you can get away without the default \DoubleSpacing, then
%\setasuspacing{\OnehalfSpacing}
%% if you use endnotes, then
   \makepagenote
\begin{document}
\maxtocdepth{subsection} % put 3 levels into the ToC
\frontmatter
\thetitlepage
\approvalpage
\asuabstract 
   abstract text
%% if you have any acknowledgements, then
  \asuacknowledgements
    acknowledgements text
% \asudedication{ text } % if you want a dedication
\tableofcontents
% \listoffigures  % if you have any figures
% \listoftables   % if you have any tables
%%% if you have more prelim sections, then
%%% \clearpage
%%% \pagestyle{plain}
%%% \prelimtitle{title} text % for each section before main text
\mainmatter
\pagestyle{asu}
\chapter{...} % start of your main text
... report on lots of incredible work, now you are on your
own until...

%% if endnotes then
   \printpagenotes
%% if a bibliography then
   \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}
%% if appendices, then
  \appendix
  \chapter{...}
  ...
%% if Biographical sketch then
   \begin{biosketch} ... \end{biosketch}
\end{document}

\end{lcode}

    If you actually try any of the above code and it does not work, then
I may have made a typo or two, or maybe you have, or perhaps we both have.
In any event, the code is more of a sketch of what might be needed than
a prescription of how it must be done.

\section{Comments}

    Having read through the requirements you will have realised
that whatever committees set them had not advanced beyond the 19th century
technology of the typewriter\index{typewriter}.\footnote{Remington sold 
their first commercial typewriter in 1873 which even then had the QWERTY 
keyboard layout. By 1910 typewriter designs were pretty well standardised.} 
When I wrote my thesis some forty years ago
it was, of necessity, single sided so that carbon copies could be made
by the typist\index{typist} (who would have objected strongly to having 
to type the hundred
and fifty or so pages six times). I must admit, though, that the sixth copy
was almost too faint and blurry to be read comfortably even though the typist
had used thin paper and kept replacing the carbon paper. 
In this day of double sided printers and double sided copiers I see no 
reason except inertia to keep a single sided requirement. Many students, 
and faculty members, have beaten their heads against
the diehards and very rarely have they managed to prevail.

\PWnote{2009/07/09}{Added comments on Sneep's thesis}
   In contrast to the ASU style I have a copy of a doctoral
thesis~\cite{SNEEP04} for Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. This is a
professionally printed 100 page, double sided, glossy paperbound book with an 
attractive coloured 
photograph of a sunset on the front and rear covers. The page size is 40.5pc by
57pc with spine and top margins of 5pc and foredge and bottom margins of
7pc.\footnote{Professional printers use points and picas for their 
measurements.}  The textblock, then, is 28.5 by 45pc set with 45 lines of 
a 10pt Lucida Bright seriffed font.
Chapter and section heads are in a sans font, with the chapter heads larger
than the section heads. Caption names are a bold sans with the caption text 
in an italic. Headers on the verso pages are the chapter title with the section
title as the recto header. The page numbers are in the footers by the foredge
margin. Altogether, a much more appealing production 
than Archibald Smythe University will permit.
